## My process
I First Added the html component. The Css was made using the design guide provided by front-end mentor. The Js is the api call so the advice changes every time the green dice is clicked or the page is refreshed. 
As this is my first project.. i will soon improvise this method with better practices.
The version 2.0 of this same project will be provided in react as well.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt how to write a good documentation so that its easy. I also maintained the flow and made the code in small steps which gave me confidence and made the learning fun at the same time.
Every code is a small or big version of ---> Input -->[process]------>Output. 
Thats how we should think...first make the html and css. then work on js part . then the improvisations.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
